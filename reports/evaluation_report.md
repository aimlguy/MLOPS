## MLOps Pipeline Demonstration

### Automatic Model Promotion

The pipeline demonstrates **automated model promotion** based on metrics:

1. **Baseline Model Training**
   ```bash
   python src/train_baseline.py --auto-promote
   ```
   - Trains simple model
   - Logs metrics to MLflow
   - Promoted to Production (first model)

2. **Improved Model Training**
   ```bash
   python src/train_improved.py --auto-promote
   ```
   - Trains better model
   - Compares with current Production
   - **Automatically replaces** baseline if AUC is higher

3. **Best Model Training**
   ```bash
   python src/train_best.py --auto-promote
   ```
   - Trains optimized model
   - Compares with current Production
   - **Automatically replaces** improved model if AUC is higher

### Key Pipeline Features

✅ **Automated Promotion:** Models automatically replace inferior predecessors  
✅ **Metrics-Driven:** Decisions based on ROC-AUC comparison  
✅ **Zero-Downtime:** New models deployed without service interruption  
✅ **Version Control:** All models tracked and retrievable  
✅ **Rollback Capable:** Previous versions archived for safety
